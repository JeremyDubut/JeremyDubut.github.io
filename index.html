						<p><b><u>Abstract:</u></b><br>
							We develop a method to approximate the moments of a discrete-time stochastic polynomial system. 
							Our method is built upon Carleman linearization with truncation. Specifically, we take a stochastic 
							polynomial system with finitely many states and transform it into an infinite-dimensional system with 
							linear deterministic dynamics, which describe the exact evolution of the moments of the original polynomial 
							system. We then truncate this deterministic system to obtain a finite-dimensional linear system, 
							and use it for moment approximation by iteratively propagating the moments along the finite-dimensional 
							linear dynamics across time. We provide efficient online computation methods for this propagation 
							scheme with several error bounds for the approximation. Our result also shows that precise values of 
							certain moments can be obtained when the truncated system is sufficiently large. Furthermore, we 
							investigate techniques to reduce the offline computation load using reduced Kronecker power. 
							Based on the obtained approximate moments and their errors, we also provide probability bounds for the 
							state to be outside of given hyperellipsoidal regions. Those bounds allow us to conduct probabilistic 
							safety analysis online through convex optimization. We demonstrate our results on a logistic map with 
							stochastic dynamics and a vehicle dynamics subject to stochastic disturbance.

						<p><b><u>Abstract:</u></b><br>
							We introduce a goal-aware extension of responsibility-sensitive safety (RSS), 
							a recent methodology for rule-based safety guarantee for automated driving systems (ADS). 
							Making RSS rules guarantee goal achievement - in addition to collision avoidance as in the original RSS — 
							requires complex planning over long sequences of manoeuvres. 
							To deal with the complexity, we introduce a compositional reasoning framework based on program logic, 
							in which one can systematically develop RSS rules for smaller subscenarios and combine them to obtain RSS 
							rules for bigger scenarios. As the basis of the framework, we introduce a program logic dFHL that accommodates 
							continuous dynamics and safety conditions. Our framework presents a dFHL-based workflow for deriving 
							goal-aware RSS rules; we discuss its software support, too. We conducted experimental evaluation using RSS 
							rules in a safety architecture. Its results show that goal-aware RSS is indeed effective in realising both 
							collision avoidance and goal achievement.

						<p><b><u>Abstract:</u></b><br>
							Bisimulation and bisimilarity are fundamental notions in comparing state-based systems. 
							Their extensions to a variety of systems have been actively pursued in recent years, 
							a notable direction being quantitative extensions. In this paper we enhance a categorical 
							framework for such extended (bi)simulation notions. We use coalgebras as system models and 
							fibrations for organizing predicates—following the seminal work by Hermida and Jacobs. 
							Endofunctor liftings are crucial predicate-forming ingredients; the first contribution of 
							this work is to extend several extant lifting techniques from particular fibrations to 
							CLat∧-fibrations over Set. The second contribution of this work is to introduce endolifting 
							morphisms as a mechanism for comparing predicates between fibrations. 
							We apply these techniques by deriving some known properties of the Hausdorff pseudometric 
							and approximate bisimulation in control theory.

							In this paper, we define and study a homology theory, that we call “natural homology”, 
							which associates a natural system of abelian groups to every space in a large class of 
							directed spaces and precubical sets. We show that this homology theory enjoys many 
							important properties, as an invariant for directed homotopy. Among its properties,

							for the class of spaces we consider, exhibits very important properties such as Hurewicz theorems, 
							and most of Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, in particular the dimension, homotopy, additivity and

						<p><b><u>Abstract:</u></b><br>
							In the open map approach to bisimilarity, the paths and their runs in a given state-based system are 
							the first-class citizens, and bisimilarity becomes a derived notion. While open maps were successfully 
							used to model bisimilarity in non-deterministic systems, the approach fails to describe quantitative 
							system equivalences such as probabilistic bisimilarity. In the present work, we see that this is indeed 
							impossible and we thus generalize the notion of open maps to also accommodate weighted and probabilistic 
							bisimilarity. Also, extending the notions of strong path and path bisimulations into this new framework, 
							we show that branching bisimilarity can be captured by this extended theory and that it can be viewed as 
							the history preserving restriction of weak bisimilarity.

						<p><b><u>Abstract:</u></b><br>
							In the field of quality assurance of hybrid systems, Platzer's differential dynamic logic (dL) is widely 
							recognized as a deductive verification method with solid mathematical foundations and sophisticated 
							tool support. Motivated by case studies provided by our industry partner, we study a relational 
							extension of dL, aiming to formally prove statements such as “an earlier engagement of the emergency 
							brake yields a smaller collision speed.” A main technical challenge is to combine two dynamics, 
							so that the powerful inference rules of dL (such as the differential invariant rules) can be applied to 
							such relational reasoning, yet in such a way that we relate two different time points. 
							Our contributions are a semantical theory of time stretching, and the resulting synchronization rule that 
							expresses time stretching by the syntactic operation of Lie derivative. 
							We implemented this rule as an extension of KeYmaera X, by which we successfully verified relational 
							properties of a few models taken from the automotive domain.

							In this paper, we develop an Isabelle/HOL library of order-theoretic concepts, such as various

							the existence of a quasi-fixed point of monotone maps over complete non-orders, and show that
							the set of quasi-fixed points is complete under a mild condition—attractivity—which is implied by
							either antisymmetry or transitivity. This result generalizes and strengthens a result by Stauti and
							Maaden. Finally, we recover Kleene's fixed-point theorem for omega-complete non-orders, again
							using attractivity to prove that Kleene's fixed points are least quasi-fixed points.

							This property allows us to prove two interesting characterisations of trees: 
							trees are exactly those pHDA that are an unfolding of another pHDA; 
							and trees are exactly the cofibrant objects, much as in the language of Quillen's model structure. 
							In particular, this last characterisation gives the premisses of a new understanding of concurrency

							There are different categorical approaches to variations of transition systems and their bisimulations. 
							One is coalgebra for a functor G, where a bisimulation is defined as a span of G-coalgebra homomorphism. 
							Another one is in terms of path categories and open morphisms, where a bisimulation is defined as a span 
							of open morphisms. This similarity is no coincidence: given a functor G, fulfilling certain conditions, 
							we derive a path-category for pointed G-coalgebras and lax homomorphisms, such that the open morphisms 
							turn out to be precisely the G-coalgebra homomorphisms. The above construction provides path-categories 
							and trace semantics for free for different flavours of transition systems: (1) non-deterministic tree automata 
							(2) regular nondeterministic nominal automata (RNNA), an expressive automata notion living in nominal sets 
							(3) multisorted transition systems. This last instance relates to Lasota's construction, 
							which is in the converse direction.

							Bisimulation and bisimilarity are fundamental notions in comparing state-based systems. 
							Their extensions to a variety of systems have been actively pursued in recent years, a notable direction 
							being quantitative extensions. In this paper we present an abstract categorical framework for such extended

							following the seminal work by Hermida and Jacobs — but our focus is on the structural aspect of fibrational 
							frameworks. Specifically we use morphisms of fi- brations as well as canonical liftings of functors via 
							Kan extensions. We apply this categorical framework by deriving some known properties of the Hausdorff 
							pseudometric and approximate bisimulation in control theory.

							The homotopy hypothesis was originally stated by Grothendieck [13]:

							e.g. for rewriting, distributed systems, (homotopy) type theory etc. But an essential feature in the 
							work set up in concurrency theory, is that time should be considered irreversible, giving rise to the 
							field of directed algebraic topology. Following the path proposed by Porter, we state here a directed 
							homotopy hypothesis: Grandis' directed topological spaces should be “equivalent” to a weak form of 
							topologically enriched categories, still very close to (∞,1)-categories. 
							We develop, as in ordinary algebraic topology, a directed homotopy equivalence and a weak equivalence, 
							and show invariance of a form of directed homology.

							We propose a categorical framework for bisimulations and unfoldings that unifies the classical approach

							respect to a subcategory of path shapes, i.e., for which one can define a nice notion of trees as glueings

							We also prove that in our framework, several notions of bisimulation coincide, in particular an

							is preserved by coreflections. This also leads us to a notion of unfolding that behaves well in the 
							accessible case: it is a right adjoint and is a universal covering, i.e., it is initial among the morphisms 
							that have the unique lifting property with respect to path shapes. As an application, we prove that the 
							universal covering of a groupoid, a standard construction in algebraic topology, is an unfolding, when

							Aczel-Mendler bisimulations are a coalgebraic extension of a variety of

							We develop a method to approximate the moments of a discrete-time stochastic polynomial system.

							linear deterministic dynamics, which describe the exact evolution of the moments of the original polynomial 
							system. We then truncate this deterministic system to obtain a finite-dimensional linear system,

							linear dynamics across time. We provide efficient online computation methods for this propagation 
							scheme with several error bounds for the approximation. Our result also shows that precise values of 
							certain moments can be obtained when the truncated system is sufficiently large. Furthermore, we 
							investigate techniques to reduce the offline computation load using reduced Kronecker power. 
							Based on the obtained approximate moments and their errors, we also provide probability bounds for the 
							state to be outside of given hyperellipsoidal regions. Those bounds allow us to conduct probabilistic 
							safety analysis online through convex optimization. We demonstrate our results on a logistic map with

						<p><b><u>Abstract:</u></b><br>
							Studying a system that evolves with time through its geometry is the main purpose of directed algebraic topology. 
							This topic emerged in computer science, more particularly in true concurrency, where Pratt introduced the higher 
							dimensional automata (HDA) in 1991 (actually, the idea of geometry of concurrency can be tracked down Dijkstra 
							in 1965). Those automata are geometric by nature: every set of n processes executing independent actions can 
							be modeled by a n-cube, and such an automaton then gives rise to a topological space, obtained by glueing 
							such cubes together. This space naturally has a specific direction of time coming from the execution flow. 
							It then seems natural to use tools from algebraic topology to study those spaces: paths model executions, 
							homotopies of paths, that is continuous deformations of paths, model equivalence of executions modulo 
							scheduling of independent actions, and so on, but all those notions must preserve the direction. 
							This brings many complications and the theory must be done again.<br>
							In this thesis, we develop homotopy and homology theories for those spaces with a direction. 
							First, my directed homotopy theory is based on deformation retracts, that is continuous deformation 
							of a big space on a smaller space, following directed paths that are inessential, meaning that they 
							do not change the homotopy type of spaces of executions. This theory is related to categories of 
							components and higher categories. Secondly, my directed homology theory follows the idea that we must 
							look at the spaces of executions and those evolves with time. This evolution of time is handled by 
							defining such homology as a diagram of spaces of executions and comparing such diagrams using a notion 
							of bisimulation. This homology theory has many nice properties: it is computable on simple spaces, 
							it is an invariant of our homotopy theory, it is invariant under simple action refinements and it has 
							a theory of exactness.

							The purpose of this report is to describe some constructions by Raussen to represent the homotopy type 
							of trace spaces of cubical complexes in directed algebraic topology. We then investigate methods to 
							compute the homotopy and homology groups of those spaces. The first method uses homotopy colimits. The second is 
							by describing the homotopy type as a generalized moment angle complex of a graphs generated by the holes
							of the complex and their relationship with respect to the order.
							We then formulated a conjecture that this is effectively the case, implying that the number of generators of 
							homology is the number of chains of holes. In the case of domension 3, this would also imply that the  
							fundamental group is isomorphic to the right-angled Artin associated with the grpah of holes, and that actually
							the trace space is a Eilenberg-MacLane space for this group. Finally, we proved this statement in some 
							easy cases such as dimension 2, chains of holes, or incomparable holes.

			<h3>ENS Paris-Saclay (2014-2017)</h3>
				This section contains archives for the exercise sessions I monitored at the CS department at the École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay (ex ENS Cachan). Most of them are in English, some in French. Some have a correction. There might be  duplicates. Those exercises are usally taken from books, lecture notes, or papers, but any typo or mistake is my own.
			<h4>Rewriting systems</h4>
				Those sessions were for students in first year of master, and were made in collaboration with Hubert Comon and Frédéric Blanqui.<br>
				<a href="teachings/archive_trs.zip">archive of exercises</a>, <a href="teachings/archive_kbcv.zip">archive of rewriting systems for kbcv</a>.
			<h4>Tree automata</h4>
				Those sessions were for students in first year of master, and were made in collaboration with Hubert Comon and Sylvain Schmitz.<br>
				<a href="teachings/archive_tata.zip">archive of exercises</a>.
			<h4>Logic</h4>
				Those sessions were undergraduates, and were made in collaboration with Lucca Hirschi, Hubert Comon, Gilles Dowek, and Étienne Lozes.<br>
